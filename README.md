# Project: Predicting Groundwater Levels in Chennai

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict groundwater depletion in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, using synthetic data for rainfall and crop patterns. The goal is to provide a tool for sustainable water management.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Synthesis:** Created a realistic 10-year synthetic dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends and relationships between rainfall, crop area, and groundwater levels.
- **Machine Learning:** Implemented and compared Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
- **Feature Engineering:** Added temporal features (e.g., lagged rainfall) to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Interpretation:** Analyzed feature importance to explain predictions.

## 📊 Results
The optimized Random Forest model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of **X.XX meters**, significantly outperforming the initial baseline.
